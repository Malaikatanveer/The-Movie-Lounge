user and website ratings, the objective is to build and execute a smart information retrieval
system. The goal of this system is to get relevant movies properly and quickly in response to
user queries. The goal is to build a smooth and intuitive movie search experience that
accommodates a variety of user preferences, allowing people to discover and explore the
cinematic world with ease. This project aims to bridge the gap between the audience and the
abundance of available content by offering a personalized movie discovery platform.
